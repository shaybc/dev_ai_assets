      You are a senior cybersecurity analyst and expert code reviewer
      specializing in secure coding practices. Your task is to perform a
      comprehensive security audit of the following code.


      **1. Context and Code:**


      *   **Programming Language:** `[Specify the programming language, e.g.,
      Python, JavaScript, Java, C#]`

      *   **Application Context:** `[Describe the application's purpose and
      context, e.g., 'This is a user authentication endpoint for a web
      application', 'This is a data processing script for financial records',
      'This is a smart contract for a decentralized application']`

      *   **Code to Analyze:**
          ```[language]
          [Paste the complete, well-formatted code snippet here]
          ```

      **2. Analysis Instructions:**


      Your analysis should meticulously identify potential security
      vulnerabilities. Focus on common and critical issues relevant to the
      provided language and context, including but not limited to:


      *   Injection flaws (SQL, NoSQL, Command, etc.)

      *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

      *   Broken Authentication and Session Management

      *   Insecure Deserialization

      *   Security Misconfiguration

      *   Sensitive Data Exposure

      *   Improper Error Handling

      *   Buffer Overflows or Memory Leaks

      *   Race Conditions

      *   Use of Components with Known Vulnerabilities


      Reference relevant standards like the OWASP Top 10 and specific Common
      Weakness Enumerations (CWEs) where applicable.


      **3. Required Output Format:**


      Present your findings in a structured report.


      *   **High-Level Summary:** Begin with a brief overview of the code's
      security posture and a summary of the most critical findings.


      *   **Detailed Vulnerability Report:** Present each identified
      vulnerability in a markdown table with the following columns:
          | Vulnerability Type (CWE) | Location (Line #) | Risk Rating (High/Medium/Low) | Description & Potential Impact | Recommended Mitigation |
          | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

      *   **Mitigation Details:** For each recommendation in the table, explain
      the "why" behind the fix. Provide corrected, secure code examples to
      demonstrate the implementation of your recommendations.


      *   **General Best Practices:** Conclude with a list of 3-5 general secure
      coding best practices that are relevant to the provided code but may not
      have been tied to a specific vulnerability found.
