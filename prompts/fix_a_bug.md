Fix the issue described below (or paste the error/stacktrace).

{{{ input }}}

Rules:
- Fix the root cause, not just the symptom
- Do not change unrelated code
- If the fix requires a behaviour change that affects callers, say so explicitly
- After the fix, provide a 2-line explanation: what was wrong and why this fix is correct
- If a regression test should be added, show it
