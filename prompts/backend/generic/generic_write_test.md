  Generate tests for the selected backend code.


  Cover in this order:

  1. **Happy path** — valid input, expected output/side effect

  2. **Validation failures** — missing fields, bad types, out-of-range values

  3. **Not found / empty** — resource doesn't exist, empty result set

  4. **External failure** — downstream service/DB throws or times out

  5. **Idempotency** (if applicable) — calling twice produces the same result


  Rules:

  - Unit tests for pure logic and service methods — mock external dependencies

  - Integration tests for persistence and protocol boundaries — use real
  DB/containers, not in-memory fakes that differ from production

  - Each test has a single clear assertion focus

  - Name tests: `should [expected outcome] when [condition]`

  - Do not test framework behaviour — test your code's response to it

  - Every bug fix warrants a regression test that would have caught it
