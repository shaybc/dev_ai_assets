    prompt: >
      Simplify the following code without changing its behaviour.

      Rules:
      - Remove duplication, dead branches, and unnecessary abstraction
      - Prefer the language's idiomatic constructs over verbose equivalents
      - Reduce nesting — flatten conditions, use early returns
      - Prefer clarity over brevity — a shorter solution that requires a comment to understand is not simpler
      - Remove comments that describe what the code does; keep only comments that explain why
      - Do not remove error handling, null guards, or defensive checks even if they appear redundant — they may be intentional
      - Do not change public interfaces, function signatures, or observable behaviour
      - Do not add new functionality, logging, or error handling that wasn't there before
      - If the code references or defines something that may be used outside this selection, do not inline or remove it — flag it with a comment instead
      - Prefer changes that produce a minimal diff — restructure only what meaningfully improves the code, not everything that could theoretically be rewritten

      Return only the simplified code — no explanation, no markdown wrapper.
