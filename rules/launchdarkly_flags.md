## Rule 1: LaunchDarkly Evaluation Must Be Centralized
- All variation and variationDetail calls must go through a shared evaluation function.
This wrapper must:
- Use the singleton instance
- Support mock/local overrides for development/testing
- Enable optional instrumentation (e.g., metrics, logging)
- Evaluation must occur as close as possible to where the flag value is used to support accurate flag status tracking.

## Rule 2: LaunchDarkly Context Object Standards
- Applications must document how context objects are constructed, including attribute sources.
- Context objects:
- Must have high cardinality (e.g., user ID, session ID)
- Must not contain or be derived from PII (e.g., don’t hash emails)
- Shared utilities should exist for creating context objects from application-specific data (e.g., createLDContextFor(userObject)).

## Rule 3: LaunchDarkly Context Custom Attributes
- Must include attributes that support release strategies:
- Build version or commit SHA
- Session ID or device ID
- Developer identifier or PR ID in ephemeral environments
Client-side SDKs must:
- Avoid frequent identify() or re-initialization calls
- Use state transitions (e.g., anonymous → authenticated) to manage identity
- Cache timestamps may be included

## Rule 4: LaunchDarkly Flag Evaluation Predictable Fallback Behavior
- Applications must handle fallback values deterministically.
- Avoid using allFlags() in production due to inconsistent behavior across SDKs.
- Fallbacks should always be passed to variation()/variationDetail() and tested in implementation.
